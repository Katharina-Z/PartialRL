# PartialRL
Modelling behavioural rat data to identify whether subjective utility differs for different impulsivity groups in rats on different reinforcement learning schedules (0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 100%).

Using JuMP (Julia) to identify the values of each action as well as identifying subjective utility, unit cost, vigour cost and future reward.
